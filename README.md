# Sorting Practice

## A basic algorithm app that visualizes a list being sorted.

This project was built for personal curiosity, because I am learning sorting algorithms in school. The app could use some UI work, and possibly more algorithms. Check out the demo below.

## What I used/learned:

* Tailwind CSS
* React useContext hook
* How algorithms work
